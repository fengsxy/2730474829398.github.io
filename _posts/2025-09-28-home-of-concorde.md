Bristol, a port city in southwest England, is renowned for its artistic atmosphere and strong industrial heritage. It is also one of the birthplaces of the British aerospace industry. The city was home to the Bristol Aeroplane Company, which played a key role in the design and manufacture of the Concorde supersonic passenger jet. For this reason, Bristol has earned the title “Home of Concorde.”

As an aviation enthusiast studying at the University of Bristol, I have always felt a special fascination with Concorde. Driven by curiosity about this remarkable chapter of aviation history, I visited the Aerospace Bristol museum to see up close the aircraft that symbolizes both speed and dreams.

## A Place Where Legends Rest

Located in Filton, Aerospace Bristol is one of the UK’s most important sites of aviation heritage. The museum houses many historically significant aircraft, but the most striking exhibit is without doubt the Concorde G-BOAF. This very aircraft operated the final Concorde flight, and now stands proudly as a symbol of Bristol’s legacy as the “Home of Concorde.”

## My Visit to Aerospace Bristol

On September 28, 2025, I took a trip to Filton, in the north of Bristol, to explore Aerospace Bristol. In the front hangar, I first came across the Bristol Type 175 Britannia, a medium-to-long-range turboprop airliner produced in the 1950s by the Bristol Aeroplane Company. Known at the time as the “Queen of the Skies,” it was admired for its smooth and quiet flight.

Next to it stood a uniquely shaped helicopter — the Bristol Type 173. Unlike most compact helicopters, this one had an unusually long fuselage and a twin-rotor design. Developed in the early 1950s, it was one of Britain’s earliest large twin-rotor transport helicopters and paved the way for later models like the Bristol Belvedere.

## Meeting the Concorde

As the highlight of the museum, the Concorde on display immediately caught my eye. Developed jointly by Aérospatiale and the British Aircraft Corporation, Concorde was one of the world’s few supersonic passenger aircraft, alongside the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144. It made its first flight in 1969 and entered service in 1976.

Concorde’s sleek delta wings, slender fuselage, and four Rolls-Royce Olympus 593 turbojet engines — each producing over 38,000 pounds of thrust — gave it a sustained cruising speed of Mach 2.02.

## The Last Flight of G-BOAF

The Concorde preserved at Aerospace Bristol, registered G-BOAF, first flew from Filton on April 20, 1979 and was delivered to British Airways on June 12, 1980 as the final Concorde ever built. On October 23, 2003, it performed its farewell flight, BA0021, from London Heathrow to Filton, returning home to rest after 45.9 years of service.


## Standing Before a Legend
Seeing the Concorde for the first time was truly breathtaking. Its long, aerodynamic shape exudes the essence of flight efficiency. The landing gear and four underwing Rolls-Royce engines reflect its immense power.

Inside, the blue interior and 2-2 seat layout embody British Airways’ luxurious 1970s design.

Peering into the cockpit through the glass, I was struck by the dense array of instruments — once the nerve center of a jet that could fly from London to New York in just 2 hours and 52 minutes, a record never to be broken.

## The Spirit of Supersonic Flight
Walking down the narrow cabin, I could almost feel the ambition that once carried this aircraft through the sound barrier and across the Atlantic. Every detail of the exhibit tells a story of human innovation, courage, and the pursuit of perfection.

Standing beside G-BOAF, I felt a deep sense of awe and nostalgia. Concorde represents not only the pinnacle of technology but also humanity’s endless desire to push boundaries.

One day, I hope to continue my Concorde journey — visiting London, Manchester, and Paris to see the other aircraft that still carry the spirit of this supersonic legend.

Farewell, Concorde — your legacy continues to fly in every dream that looks toward the sky.
